# Regular Expression To Finite Automata Converter Web App

This is a Web App build using HTML , CSS , JavaScript ,etc which converts Regular Expressions to Finite Automata.

Functions performed by the Web App :

1. Regular Expression to NFA (Non Deterministic Finite Automata) With Epsilon Conversion
2. Regular Expression to NFA Without Epsilon Conversion
3. Regular Expreesion to DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata) Conversion
4. String Acceptance For Regular Expression

The Web app uses colorful nodes and edges graph visualization techniques to represent Finite Automatas and Visualize the String acceptance for Regular Expression.

Tools/Concepts Implemented :

1. Graphs (Bread First Search Traversal)
2. Data Structures and Algorithms
3. Theory Of Computation (Finite Automatas and Regular Expressions)
4. HTML , CSS , JavaScript
